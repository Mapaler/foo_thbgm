Usage:
step1: Install foo_thbgm.fb2k-component or extract foo_thbgm.dll into fb2k's components folder.
step2: Move thxml file to your game's installation directory.
step3: Using fb2k to open the thxml file, then enjoy your life!

Something you should know:
Foobar2000 v1.1 or newer required to run this plugin.
Four new thbgm entries are added into fb2k's playback menu.

Loop forever means BGM will always loop. Don't forget to disable loop forever mode when converting these BGMs.
Read metadata will use fb2k's built-in splitter and decoder to read real BGM file's music tag instead of thxml. It's not a preset option since it will speed down unpack efficiency a lot.
The plugin can also extract files from raw binary stream or several type of file archives, just check the Extract Files option, all the bgm files will be dumped in a new folder under current path.

Some sound cards don't support play 神霊廟's ghost mode in Kernel Streaming or WASAPI becuase the frequency is 22050Hz.
You have to add resampler in DSP Manager or change the output setting to others.

Feature:
1. A-B loop for any audio format.
2. Directly play bgm files of touhou and some related doujin games below.
